\section{Skills}
\begin{itemize} 
\item Breezes through hand-written calculations quickly and accurately
\item Employs typesetting program LaTeX to write math equations for easy readability and beautiful presentation.
\item Able to explain complex things so a child may understand, yet can produce sophisticated explanations as the need arises
\item Experience solving unfamiliar problems and guiding other to a solution everyone involved understands - leaves no one behind
\item Keen ability to recognize faces, a “super recognizer.” Never forgets a person's face, retains long term memory of meeting people, recognizes someone before they recognize me, and can pick familiar faces from a crowd easily

% Commented out for space for references
% \item Quick comprehension and good retention after reading % short sequences of numbers, strings, or patterns, requiring 
% only a brief glance at two-factor authentication codes or % bus stop ID.
